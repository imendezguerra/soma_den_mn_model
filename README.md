# soma_den_mn_model
Two compartment motor neuron (MN) pool model based on (Elias and Kohn, 2013). Every MN is comprised by a cylindrical soma and dendrite and coupled with a model of motor unit (MU) twitch for force production. The dendrites of the MNs include L-type Ca2+ channels to simulate the effect of persistent inward currents. The code is implemented in Brian2.
